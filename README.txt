INSTALLATION
*****************************************************************************
1. You should have unpacked the install archive into your Addons folder (i.e 
	the FireAdmin folder is in the Addons folder).
2. ON THE SERVER -> You may wish to review the security level requirements 
	for certain GM commands. For example, the .account onlinelist by default 
	needs a level 3. If your GMs dont have level 3, they wont be able to use 
	the WHO tab.
3. Click the TA icon on the minimap frame. Do NOT open FireAdmin any other 
	way just yet.
4. Click the Tickets tab. If you receive and error, DO NOT close it, just 
	click the Tickets tab again.
5. Click the Change Language button to reload the addon.
6. Click the TA icon on the minimap frame. Do NOT open FireAdmin any other 
	way just yet.
7. Click the Who tab. If you receive and error, DO NOT close it, just click the 
	Who tab again.
8. Click the Change Language button to reload the addon. These steps are required
	on some locales in order to properly create the new local tables that the 
	addon uses to store tickets and 'who' information'
